I'm a Computer Engineer student at a Inteli, that takes places in brazil. I'm on my first year of my graduation, however I have made a technical course which I learned C#, C/C++, Python and a little of Java. Beside those languages, I have study MySql and Html. 
Unfortunatelly, I do not have an project yet, however I'm working on one. Probably posting it soon. :)
